    <h1>My Journey from a Government School Background</h1>
    <p><small>Published: July 8, 2025</small></p>

    <p>I'm one among millions who come from an economically lower-middle-class background, having studied in government schools. These roots have deeply shaped who I am today.</p>

    <p>Through all the highs and lows, I cherish every experience — even the bad ones — as they have become turning points in my life. I’ve come to understand that experience doesn’t just come from success; it often comes from setbacks. I firmly believe that it doesn’t matter whether you start with a rupee or a million — what matters is that you start, and keep moving in the right direction.</p>

    <p>I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, followed by a Master of Science in Information Technology. Along the way, I’ve also earned a few professional certifications that helped deepen my expertise.</p>

    <p>I’ve been in the IT industry for over 12 years. During this journey, I’ve worked with several organizations on a variety of projects. My core focus has been on software testing — including test automation, performance testing, and performance engineering. I’ve also worn other hats briefly, such as IT business analyst, project manager, and production support engineer. These roles gave me a broader understanding of the software development lifecycle and team collaboration.</p>

    <p>Technically, I’ve worked with Java, Selenium, JMeter, and many other tools. My primary domain experience lies in the BFSI industry (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance).</p>

    <p>I find Alvin Toffler’s quote incredibly relevant in today’s fast-changing world:  
    <em>“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”</em></p>

    <p>I’m deeply interested in topics like technology, business, the economy, insurance, and investments. I’m always on the lookout for ways to improve myself — professionally and personally — to become a better version of who I was yesterday.</p>
